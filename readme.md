This project was focused on creating a Discord bot for managing live streams. It has some extra functionalities, like using CRON to notify about live streams and birthdays, some basic image manipulation, etc. It was connected to a Firebase RTDB (I've even managed to include a json file with some private credentials ðŸ˜… A rookie mistake, I'd definitely **not** store it this way today).
